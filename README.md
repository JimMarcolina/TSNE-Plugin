# tSNE

# **Description**

T-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE) is an algorithm for performing dimensionality reduction, allowing visualization of complex multi-dimensional data in fewer dimensions while still maintaining the structure of the data.

# **Dependencies**

The tSNE plugin is included with FlowJo v10.1r7 and later. Like all plugins, it requires that version or later to run.

The tSNE plugin does *not* require the R programming language.

# **System Requirements**

Note that the tSNE algorithm is computationally intensive, planning and preparing your data will save you time and computational resources. See the Practical Considerations heading on the [tSNE](http://docs.flowjo.com/d2/plugins/tsne/) page on the FlowJo documentation site for suggestions on how to use the algorithm efficiently.

# **Installation Instructions**

The tSNE plugin is included with FlowJo.

If you need to update or re-install tSNE, please see the [Installing Plugins](http://docs.flowjo.com/d2/plugins/installing-plugins/) page for detailed information on how to obtain and set up FlowJo plugins.

# **Documentation**

For further suggestions on how to get the most out of tSNE, refer to the [tSNE page](http://docs.flowjo.com/d2/plugins/tsne/) on the FlowJo documentation site.
